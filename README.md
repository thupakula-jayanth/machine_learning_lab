## ðŸ§ª Lab Experiments

The following machine learning tasks are included in this lab:

1. **Data Handling**  
   Loading datasets, exploring structure, handling missing values, and initial inspection.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and data splitting for training/testing.

3. **Linear Regression**  
   Predictive modeling using scikit-learn's `LinearRegression`.

4. **Logistic Regression**  
   Classification for binary outcome prediction.

5. **Decision Trees**  
   Visual and interpretable models for classification problems.

6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
   Instance-based learning using distance metrics.

7. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**  
   Optimal-margin classifiers for classification tasks.

8. **Naive Bayes Classifier**  
   Probabilistic learning based on Bayesâ€™ theorem.

9. **K-Means Clustering**  
   Unsupervised learning to identify clusters in unlabeled data.
