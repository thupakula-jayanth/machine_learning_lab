## ðŸ§ª Lab Experiments

The following machine learning tasks are included in this lab:

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling, and data splitting.

2. **Linear Regression**  
   Predictive modeling using scikit-learn's `LinearRegression`.

3. **Logistic Regression**  
   Classification for binary outcome prediction.

4. **Decision Trees**  
   Visual and interpretable models for classification problems.

5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
   Instance-based learning using distance metrics.

6. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**  
   Optimal-margin classifiers for classification tasks.

7. **Naive Bayes Classifier**  
   Probabilistic learning based on Bayesâ€™ theorem.

8. **K-Means Clustering**  
   Unsupervised learning to identify clusters in unlabeled data.
